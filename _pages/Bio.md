I will be joining the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University in December 2023. Now I am a researcher working at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), where I joined in 2017. I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Shandong University in 2013, and I obtained my PhD from North Carolina State University in 2017, advised by <a href="https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/nlu2/">Professor Ning Lu</a>.
