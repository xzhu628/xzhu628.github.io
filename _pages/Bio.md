I joined the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University in December 2023. I also hold a joint affiliation at <a href="https://www.nrel.gov">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a>, where I joined in 2017 and worked as a research scientist before joining Oregon State University. I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Shandong University in 2013, and I obtained my PhD from North Carolina State University in 2017, advised by <a href="https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/nlu2/">Professor Ning Lu</a>.
