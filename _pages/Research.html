## Research Vision

In the Next-Generation Unified Energy System Lab (NEXUS), we develop scalable, intelligent, and adaptive solutions to enhance the reliability and resilience of modern energy and power systems. Our research addresses key challenges in grid operation and anomaly mitigation, market design and demand flexibility, and grid sensing and infrastructure monitoring. To tackle these challenges, we leverage AI, risk-aware control, and human-centered methodologies, integrating economic and human factors to enable higher levels of electrified load, sustainable energy integration, and reliable, safe power delivery.

## Research Areas

### Area 1: Risk-Aware Learning and Control for Grid Operations
We develop learning and control methods that account for uncertainty and operational risk to anticipate, detect, and mitigate grid anomalies, enhancing reliability and resilience under normal and extreme conditions.

### Area 2: Market Design and Demand Flexibility
We design market mechanisms and bidding strategies that enable reliable and efficient use of demand-side flexibility, accounting for uncertainty in distributed energy resources and customer behavior to improve market efficiency and reduce system costs.

### Area 3: Agentic AI and Human-Centered Grid Operations
We develop agentic AI systems that collaborate with human operators through interactive decision support and adaptive explanations, enabling effective human–AI teaming and continuous co-evolution in power system operations.

### Area 4: Data-Driven Grid Intelligence: Monitoring, Forecasting, and Coordination
We leverage multi-modal data analytics and computer vision to enable multi-scale load forecasting, infrastructure monitoring, and coordination of large electrified loads such as data centers and fast-charging hubs. This research supports proactive asset maintenance, efficient system planning, and grid-aware operation of energy-intensive facilities.
