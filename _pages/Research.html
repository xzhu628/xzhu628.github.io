<p>
  In the Next-Generation Unified Energy System Lab (NEXUS), we develop scalable,
  intelligent, and adaptive solutions to enhance the reliability and resilience
  of modern energy and power systems. Our research addresses key challenges in
  grid operation and anomaly mitigation, market design and demand flexibility,
  and grid sensing and infrastructure monitoring. To tackle these challenges,
  we leverage AI, risk-aware control, and human-centered methodologies,
  integrating economic and human factors to enable higher levels of electrified
  load, sustainable energy integration, and reliable, safe power delivery.
</p>

<h2>Research Areas</h2>

<h3>Area 1: Risk-Aware Learning and Control for Grid Operations</h3>
<p>
  We develop learning and control methods that account for uncertainty and
  operational risk to anticipate, detect, and mitigate grid anomalies,
  enhancing reliability and resilience under normal and extreme conditions.
</p>

<h3>Area 2: Market Design and Demand Flexibility</h3>
<p>
  We design market mechanisms and bidding strategies that enable reliable and
  efficient use of demand-side flexibility, accounting for uncertainty in
  distributed energy resources and customer behavior to improve market
  efficiency and reduce system costs.
</p>

<h3>Area 3: Agentic AI and Human-Centered Grid Operations</h3>
<p>
  We develop agentic AI systems that collaborate with human operators through
  interactive decision support and adaptive explanations, enabling effective
  human–AI teaming and continuous co-evolution in power system operations.
</p>

<h3>Area 4: Data-Driven Grid Intelligence: Monitoring, Forecasting, and Coordination</h3>
<p>
  We leverage multi-modal data analytics and computer vision to enable multi-scale
  load forecasting, infrastructure monitoring, and coordination of large
  electrified loads such as data centers and fast-charging hubs. This research
  supports proactive asset maintenance, efficient system planning, and
  grid-aware operation of energy-intensive facilities.
